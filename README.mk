## Introduction
This project was developed as part of the module Programming Techniques II, from the Diversidade Tech program, promoted by Let's Code from Ada and Suzano, in december/2022.

Its goals were to perform a brief exploratory analysis on cholera cases, deaths and fatality rate from different continents and World Health Organization (WHO) regions.

## Dataset

The dataset (data.csv) was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/cholera-dataset).

## Visualização dos dados
Analysis is better observed in the .html reports, found in the following directory (...). These files were provided to favor dataviz and remove the need to run the codes. It is also recommended to open the .html and .ipynb files in Mozilla Firefox.


## Data treament files

Module.py is the same as 1_data_treatment.ipynb: 1_data_treatment.ipynb was kept for better dataviz, and module.py was created to import the pre-treated data to the other files.
