## Introduction
This project was created in December 2022 as a part of the "Diversidade Tech" program offered by "Let's Code from Ada" and "Suzano". It was a part of the Programming Techniques II module.

Its objective was to do a quick exploratory investigation of cholera cases, deaths, and fatality rates across several continents and WHO regions.

## Dataset

The dataset (data.csv) was obtained from Kaggle, and can also be found by clicking [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/cholera-dataset).

## Data visualization
The analysis is best seen in the.html reports, which may be accessed in the [html_files](https://github.com/CarolLuz/cholera_analysis/tree/main/html_files) directory. These files were made available to help with data visualizationÂ and eliminate the need to execute the scripts. It is also advised to use Mozilla Firefox to open the.html and.ipynb files.


## Data treament files

Module.py and 1_data_treatment.ipynb are identical: 1_data_treatment.ipynb was kept for better dataviz, and module.py was created to import the pre-treated data to the other files.
